            <p>It has long been a Western tradition to use dandelions as a wishing agent. Inspired by the way the wind sweeps their tiny seed heads off, children blow on the flower and think of a wish they want to come true. Here, Ruth B imagines herself in a field of dandelions, blowing the seeds away. She hopes and prays her crush will reciprocate her feelings and be her lover.
                Ruth B wrote the song after looking out of the window and seeing a dandelion. She told Nylon that a fortnight previously she'd watched an interview with Sia, who discussed her songwriting process. The Australian songsmith said, "One of the best ways to write is to pick a pretty word and write around that." So, Ruth thought, "Wow, dandelion is a really pretty word. I should write around it."
                Ruth B recorded the song for her debut album Safe Haven, releasing it as the second and final promotional single on April 27, 2017. Just under five years later, "Dandelion" entered the UK singles chart after going viral on TikTok.
                In 1967, The Rolling Stones released the best-known song titled "Dandelion," where they allude to the flower's supposed magical properties.
                <br>
                Dandelion don't tell no lies
                Dandelion will make you wise
                Tell me if she laughs or cries
                Blow away dandelion
